# Comparing-Languages-Longest-Increasing-Subsequence

**CSC254 Assignment 1:** Find a (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence that is as long as possible, and in which the elements are monotonically increasing left-to-right. 

Languages Implemented:
- [x] Ada
- [ ] Ocaml
- [ ] Python
- [x] Go
- [ ] Prolog

Extra Credit:
- [x] Try some other languagesâ€”from the lists above or beyond.  Java or C++ would be interesting. 
- [x] Use dynamic programming to optimize the asymptotic run time of your programs (already required for at least one program in 454). 
- [ ] Prove that any sequence of n2+1 distinct integers has either an increasing or a decreasing subsequence of length n+1. 
- [x] Modify one or more of your programs to output all longest increasing subsequences. 
- [ ] For Prolog, Python, OCaml, and/or Scheme, modify your programs to read from standard input, rather than the interpreter prompt.
