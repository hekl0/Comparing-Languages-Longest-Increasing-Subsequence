# Comparing-Languages-Longest-Increasing-Subsequence

### Summary

**CSC254 Assignment 1:** Find a (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence that is as long as possible, and in which the elements are monotonically increasing left-to-right. 

### Languages Implemented:
- [x] Ada
- [x] Ocaml
- [x] Python
- [x] Go
- [X] Prolog

### Extra Credit:
- [x] Try some other languagesâ€”from the lists above or beyond.  Java or C++ would be interesting. *(Add C++ program)*
- [x] Use dynamic programming to optimize the asymptotic run time of your programs (already required for at least one program in 454). *(Complexity: O(Nlog(N)), Algorithm Fenwick Tree)*
- [ ] Prove that any sequence of n2+1 distinct integers has either an increasing or a decreasing subsequence of length n+1. 
- [x] Modify one or more of your programs to output all longest increasing subsequences. *(C++ program will print all solutions)*
- [ ] For Prolog, Python, OCaml, and/or Scheme, modify your programs to read from standard input, rather than the interpreter prompt. 

### Run & tesing
Write input to file `input.txt` and run with `Makefile`:
- Run C++ program: `make C++`
- Run Go program: `make Go`
- Run Ada program: `make Ada`

Run `make clean` to clean object files.
