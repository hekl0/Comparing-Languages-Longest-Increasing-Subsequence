Extra Credit Work:
- Try other language: C++
- Use dynamic programming (Complexity O(N*logN)): Go, C++, Ada, Python
- Modify one program to print all LIS: C++

Ada:
- Complexity O(n*logn)
- Run:
    + With Makefile: enter the list in file input.txt and run make Ada
    + Manually: gnatmake a1.adb to compile, and run with ./a1, input the list in the terminal

Go:
- Complexity: O(n*logn)
- Run:
    + With Makefile: enter the list in file input.txt and run make Go
    + Manually: go run a1.go and then input the list in the terminal

C++:
- Complexity: O(n*logn*number of LIS)
- Run:
    + With Makefile: enter the list in file input.txt and run make C++
    + Manually: g++ -o a1.out a1.cpp to compile, and run with ./a1.out, input the list in the terminal

Prolog:
- Complexity: O(2^n)
- Run:
    + Manually: swipl -q -l a1.pl, and then run with command, in example, lis([31, 41, 59, 26, 53, 58, 97, 23, 85], L).
